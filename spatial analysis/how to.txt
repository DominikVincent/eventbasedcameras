Steps:
-find start and set it in the code
-set base variables pixel number
-set offset x and y, and other variables
-set rpm and exact angle

-set boundary size
	-celex 3,15

-run program to end


-----------------------------Other settings
low rpm (41.3), 50000ms window to check alignment
high rpm (200), 10000ms window to check alignment

Quarter lap cuz speed was wayy too inconsistent
