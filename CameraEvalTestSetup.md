#Camera evaluation test setups
In this document we the test setups used to compare the dvs DVXplorer 640x480, the Propesee 640x480 VGA and the Celex 1000x800 event cameras.

#Flash test

###Physical setup
For the flash test we setup a simple surface 15cm centered in front of the camera lens, the side of a small cardboard box. 
We used the same lens with static sensors and the same mount on every sensor. The lens we used was TODO, with the settings TODO.
We then flashed the phone camera of a samsung a50 phone at a periodicity of 10hz, having it stay lit for approximately 25% of the time and be turned off for the rest. 
We positioned the phone TODO cm right of the center of the camera sensor, with the flashlight aimed roughly at the center of the cardboard box.

###Analysis
