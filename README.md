# eventbasedcameras
This repository was used in part of the Bachelor Thesis aimed to investigate optical flow accuracy for event based cameras. //TODO link

## Scripts
The repository contains a few useful scripts which might help to reduce some workload. All of them, but one (script to convert to aedat from custom np format) use python3 to run.
The following scripts are available:
 - from prophesee .dat format to custom np format
 - from inivation aedat4 to custom np format
 - from custom np format to .aedat so that it can be replayed in jAER
 - if running of algortihms in jAER they produce a .txt file. We provide a script converting from the .txt to np array
 - analysis of of-correctness in the given scenes of the thesis
 - analysis of spatial accuracy see at the thesis for more detail
 - analsis of the cameras flash response see thesis for more detail
 - some more minor scripts for generating some pictures and graphs
